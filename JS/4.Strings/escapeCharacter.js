// Mostly known as '\' Backslash escape character.

// Whenever we encounter same type of quotes in a single(same) string, the to avoid the Syntax error, we use escape character.

// For eg:

let random = "Hello!! mfs, this is \"Error 2.00\"";

// If we hadn't used backslach escape character, then it would have thorwn syntax error.
// We can also use alternative quotes ('' or ``) but using backslash escape character is more relevent.



console.log(random);

// let random = "Hello!! mfs, this is "Error 2.00"";
// If we dare to do this then it will throw syntax error and we will be deprived from getting expected Output.
